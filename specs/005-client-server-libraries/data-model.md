# Data Model: Client-server Query

## Entities

### Query
- Fields:
  - correlationId: string (opaque, client-generated)
  - payload: domain-specific request data
- Invariants:
  - Read-only; MUST NOT change replicated state
  - Handled by current leader

### QueryResponse
- Fields:
  - correlationId: string (matches Query)
  - result: response data or error info
- Invariants:
  - One completion delivered per correlationId on client side

### CorrelationId
- Type: opaque string (e.g., UUID)
- Source: generated by client
- Usage: match Query to QueryResponse across retries and out-of-order delivery

## Relationships
- Query 1..1 â†’ QueryResponse (by correlationId)

## Validation Rules
- correlationId present on both Query and QueryResponse
- Query never routed through state machine

## Notes for kvstore example
- Replace GET command with Query-based GET using this model.
